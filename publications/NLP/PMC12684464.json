    "abstract": "Objective Understanding demographic differences in planned suicide methods is key to prevention efforts, including means restriction. Although prior studies have identified gender differences in suicide methods, the stability vs emergence of those gender differences across age bands has not previously been examined. We aimed to identity stability or emergence of gender differences in planned suicide methods across development by testing for age by gender interactions, in a large cohort of crisis conversations. Method We analyzed an archival dataset of 34,465 deidentified conversations from Crisis Text Line between January 5, 2017, and January 4, 2024. A total of 5,136 texters selected boy/man as the only applicable gender option, 23,387 selected only girl/woman, and 5,942 selected any other combination of gender identity options (transgender and gender diverse category [TGD]). Planned suicide methods were evaluated using a multi-step transformers-based natural language processing pipeline to extract and classify methods. Results There were significant effects of age for each of the most common planned suicide methods (overdose, sharp objects, hanging, firearms, jumping, vehicles, poisoning, drowning, asphyxiation, and “other”). There were significant effects of gender for overdose, hanging, firearms, jumping, vehicles, poison, asphyxiation, and other. There were age by gender interactions for overdose: χ 2  (6) = 33.097,  p  = .00001, firearms, χ 2  (6) = 30.48,  p  = .00003, and sharp objects, χ 2  (6) = 21.82,  p  = .001305. Conclusion Gender effects differed across age groups for several of the most common suicide methods. These gender-specific age patterns present possibilities for targeted prevention efforts.",

In addition, an &#8220;other&#8221; category included cases not categorized into one of those clusters. Therefore, the final analysis was conducted on 10 clusters.</p></sec><sec id=\"sec2.4\"><title>Demographic Data</title><p id=\"p0075\">Demographic data were collected via a post-conversation survey completed by approximately 20% of texters. We considered 4 age bins: age 13 years and younger; age 14 to 17 years; age 18 to 24 years, and age 25 years and over. For gender, we considered 3 gender categories: Girl/Woman only (texters whose only selected response was girl/woman), Boy/Man only, and TGD (texters who selected any combination of other choices). Of the TGD group, the gender selections were as follows: 9.8% agender, 13.8% genderfluid, 14.8% genderqueer, 0.3% intersex, 22.0% nonbinary, 35.0% transgender (selecting Trans, Trans Masculine, or Trans Feminine), 0.8% Two Spirit, and 23.7% write-in. Of the TGD group, 4.6% additionally selected Girl/Woman and 5.2% additionally selected Boy/Man. (For example, texters might select &#8216;Trans&#8217; and &#8216;Girl/Woman&#8217;).

Our primary aim was to identify possible age by gender interactions. For each of the 10 planned suicide methods (including &#8220;other&#8221;), we built a logistic regression predicting the presence/absence of that method, with age, gender, and the age by gender interaction as predictors. Interactions and main effects were considered significant at <italic toggle=\"yes\">p</italic> &lt; .005 (Bonferroni correction for 10 planned suicide methods).

Overall, we found that the most common methods in this sample included overdose (present in 51.7% of conversations), sharp objects (34.6%), hanging (13.7%), and firearms (9.8%). This is consistent with existing epidemiological literature that shows that poisoning (including overdose) is the most common method in nonfatal suicide attempts.<xref rid=\"bib14\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>14</sup></xref> To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine whether gender differences in suicide methods are stable across development or whether they emerge during adolescence or early adulthood.</p><p id=\"p0235\">We found main effects of age for each planned suicide method. Methods including sharp objects, hanging, jumping, and drowning were most common at younger age bands. Other methods were most common in older texters, including overdose, firearms, vehicles, poison, and asphyxiation. Age differences may reflect differences in access or knowledge (particularly for firearms and vehicles). Parents, providers, and public health officials should be aware that sharp objects, hanging, jumping, and drowning may be particularly likely to be involved in suicide plans of children and adolescents 13 years of age and younger.</p><p id=\"p0240\">Our results recapitulate some well-known gender differences, including higher selection of methods including firearms, jumping, and hanging in the Boy/Man group than in the Girl/Woman group, and greater planning of overdose methods in the Girl/Woman group than in the Boy/Man group. Our study expands a sparse existing literature on suicide methods in TGD individuals. We found differing patterns for this group by suicide method. This pattern reflects a complex interplay between suicide method and gender identity.</p><p id=\"p0245\">For several suicide methods, gender effects differed across age groups. The increase across age bands in overdose for the Boy/Man group, steep increase in firearms between ages 18 and 24 years and 25 years and older in the Girl/Woman and TGD groups, and shallower plateauing of sharp objects in the TGD group all suggest gender-specific age patterns that warrant further investigation.</p><p id=\"p0250\">This study has limitations. First, the sample may be unrepresentative (of the US population, individuals in crisis, and/or the Crisis Text Line texter pool): (1) individuals in this sample completed the voluntary post-conversation survey; survey takers may differ from non&#8211;survey takers; and (2) texters who required an emergency services intervention are not included in this analysis (though as a supplemental analysis, we did examine planned suicide methods in emergency services intervention conversations, which were quite similar to the conversations in the current analysis [<xref rid=\"appsec1\" ref-type=\"sec\">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>, available online]). Second, we did not assess sex assigned at birth, and we did not formally assess cisgender vs transgender identity. The gender distribution of texters to this service is not representative of the US population: for example, there are relatively few texters identifying as boy/man only. Although the raw numbers are still large enough for analysis, the unusual gender distribution should be noted. Finally, although the sample included individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds (<xref rid=\"tbl1\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 1</xref>), analysis of possible racial or ethnic differences in planned suicide methods was not performed; this could be an important future direction.</p><p id=\"p0255\">This study also has a number of strengths. Our sample includes more than 6,000 children 13 years of age and younger, a population that is understudied and shows unique patterns in our dataset. We found that the youngest group was more likely to select planned suicide methods including sharp objects, hanging, jumping, and drowning. Clinicians and family members should be aware that younger suicidal individuals may be more likely than older people to select these methods, and should plan carefully when assessing and restricting access to means. In addition, we included more than 5,000 TGD individuals, who showed complex patterns across suicide methods and were more likely than other people to select poison as a planned suicide method. To our knowledge, only 1 prior study of suicide methods has included more than 100 TGD individuals, and that sample included only adults.<xref rid=\"bib22\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>22</sup></xref> Because TGD youth experience elevated rates of suicidality, understanding planned suicide methods is particularly critical for this vulnerable subpopulation. Future work could help to identify drivers of selection of different planned means across demographic groups.</p><p id=\"p0260\">Overall, these findings demonstrate that across age brackets, overdose is an exceptionally common planned suicide method in crisis conversations. Further analyzing this category to examine specific drugs mentioned in overdose conversations could guide clinical and policy efforts toward more effective lethal means restriction practices.</p><p id=\"p0265\">To summarize, in a large sample of text-based crisis conversations, we evaluated planned suicide means by age and gender using an NLP/ML-based extraction and classification strategy. We found broad age differences across planned methods, including more plans involving sharp objects, hanging, jumping, and drowning in the age 13 years and younger group. This study lays the groundwork for future NLP/ML-based work on unstructured, suicide-related conversational data, with potential critical implications for suicide prevention and public health.</p></sec><sec id=\"sec5\"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id=\"p0270\"><bold>Ignacio J.

Objective Understanding demographic differences in planned suicide methods is key to prevention efforts, including means restriction. Although prior studies have identified gender differences in suicide methods, the stability vs emergence of those gender differences across age bands has not previously been examined. We aimed to identity stability or emergence of gender differences in planned suicide methods across development by testing for age by gender interactions, in a large cohort of crisis conversations. Method We analyzed an archival dataset of 34,465 deidentified conversations from Crisis Text Line between January 5, 2017, and January 4, 2024. A total of 5,136 texters selected boy/man as the only applicable gender option, 23,387 selected only girl/woman, and 5,942 selected any other combination of gender identity options (transgender and gender diverse category [TGD]). Planned suicide methods were evaluated using a multi-step transformers-based natural language processing pipeline to extract and classify methods. Results There were significant effects of age for each of the most common planned suicide methods (overdose, sharp objects, hanging, firearms, jumping, vehicles, poisoning, drowning, asphyxiation, and &#8220;other&#8221;). There were significant effects of gender for overdose, hanging, firearms, jumping, vehicles, poison, asphyxiation, and other. There were age by gender interactions for overdose: &#967; 2 (6) = 33.097, p = .00001, firearms, &#967; 2 (6) = 30.48, p = .00003, and sharp objects, &#967; 2 (6) = 21.82, p = .001305. Conclusion Gender effects differed across age groups for several of the most common suicide methods. These gender-specific age patterns present possibilities for targeted prevention efforts. Plain language summary Restricting access to lethal means of suicide is one of the most important ways that suicide can be prevented. Further, planned suicide methods tend to differ by gender based on prior research. This study used natural language processing to examine how planned suicide methods emerge over adolescence and investigated the link between gender and planned methods. Results showed that children ages 13 and under were more likely to select methods including sharp objects, hanging, jumping, and drowning. In addition, there are gender effects that differ by age for some common planned suicide methods including overdose, firearms, and sharp objects. These results could help health care providers and public health officials prevent suicide and advise patients and families on restricting access to lethal suicide means.

Restricting access to suicide means is 1 of only 2 strategies demonstrated to prevent suicide at the population level. 1 , 2 The frequency with which different suicide methods are used is influenced by demographic, social, and cultural factors that affect each method&#8217;s lethality, socio-cultural acceptability, and practical and cognitive availability. 3 These factors tend to differ across demographic groups, including gender, race, and age. 4 , 5 Suicide methods are highly sensitive to contextual cultural factors, and they tend to change over time. 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 One reason that it is important to identify suicide methods under consideration in suicidal individuals is that methods differ drastically in their lethality. 11 , 12 In a meta-analysis, case fatality rates ranged from 89.7% (for firearms) to 4% (for cutting). 13 Prior work has shown that, in the United States, firearms are the most common means used in completed suicides, followed by suffocation including hanging, and poisoning including overdose. 14 , 15 However, in non-fatal medically treated suicide attempts, those rates are quite different: poisoning is much more common (63%), followed by suffocation (3%) and firearms (1%). 14 Across all fatal and non-fatal suicide acts in 2015, poisoning was by far the most common method (incidence rate: 112.7 per 100,000), followed by other methods combined (drowning, cutting, jumping, etc; 63.3 per 100,000), suffocation (9.1), and firearms (8.0). 14 Suicide Methods Across the Lifespan Most studies of suicide means have focused on adult deaths by suicide. A small existing body of literature raises the possibility that suicide means selection may differ by age group. In a sample of 134 children in the United States 5 to 11 years of age who died by suicide between 2013 and 2017, hanging or suffocation was the most common method (78.4% of cases), followed by firearms (18.7%) and poisoning/other (3%). 16 One prior analysis of both completed suicides and non-fatal medically treated suicide attempts in the United States described broad changes in the suicide means distribution across ages: for example, poisoning (including overdose) had an incidence rate of 161.2 per 100,000 in the 10- to 19-year-old age band in 2015, which dropped systematically across age bands, ultimately landing at 28.3 per 100,000 in the oldest band. 14 Gender Differences in Suicide Methods Gender differences in suicide methods are a robustly documented phenomenon: in the United States, women are more likely than men to attempt suicide via nonviolent methods such as overdose than by violent methods such as cutting, jumping, hanging/suffocation, and firearms. 17 A number of possible explanations for this discrepancy have been articulated: compared to men, women may have lower lethal intent, greater concern about distress in bystanders, greater concern about their physical appearance, and/or lower technical familiarity with methods including firearms and hanging. 17 , 18 , 19 To varying degrees, all of these explanations reflect gender differences in socialization. However, little is known about how suicide method selection by gender emerges developmentally over the course of childhood and adolescence. Suicide Methods in Transgender and Gender Diverse Individuals Little is known about suicide methods in transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals, in part because gender identity is often not recorded in mortality records. 20 One prior US study that included 16 transgender male and 12 transgender female individuals 12 to 29 years of age found lower rates of suicide death by firearm (8%-13%, vs 55% for non-LGBT male individuals). 20 In another examination of the National Violent Death Reporting System data, suicide death by firearm was less common in transgender individuals (24.5%) than in cisgender individuals (51.9%), with no significant differences across the other methods examined (hanging or suffocation, poisoning, and other). 21 In contrast, in an analysis of Veterans Health Administration data, transgender individuals had higher hazard ratios than non-transgender people for suicide death by poisoning (odds ratio [OR] = 2.03) and by firearms (OR = 3.22). 22 Overall, an emerging literature on suicide deaths suggests possible differences in suicide methods for TGD individuals, but further work is urgently needed, particularly at younger age bands. Gender Differences in Suicide Methods Across the Lifespan Some prior analyses in international contexts have suggested that gender differences in suicide methods may differ across age bands within adulthood. 8 , 9 One prior study found that gender differences in some suicide methods were present at age 10 to 19 years: firearms were the most common method in male individuals, and asphyxiation (hanging/strangling/suffocation) was the most common method in female individuals. 23 To our knowledge, no existing work has formally tested whether gender differences in suicide methods are stable across development or emerge during adolescence or early adulthood. The goal of the present study was to identity stability or emergence of gender differences in suicide methods across development by testing for age by gender interactions, and to extend this work to TGD individuals. To do so, we capitalized on a unique large dataset of crisis conversations at Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit organization that provides text-based crisis support. We used a series of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) strategies to extract and classify mentions of planned suicide methods from conversations with texters in crisis in order to examine gender differences developmentally. Method Sample We evaluated Crisis Text Line conversations that occurred over a 7-year time frame between January 5, 2017, and January 4, 2024. We included only conversations in which the crisis counselor (CC) indicated that the texter had mentioned a planned suicide method, in which we detected at least 1 method, and in which self-reported age and gender were available (N = 34,465). The organization serves texters of all ages. Importantly, the post-conversation survey in which demographics are collected is not presented to texters if an emergency services intervention is initiated, so the 34,465 conversations exclude these cases. Sample demographics are presented in Table 1 . Full details of sample size at each elimination step are provided in the the Supplement ( Supplemental Methods ). This research was evaluated by Sterling Institutional Review Board, which issued an exempt determination. Table 1 Sample Demographics Category n % Age, y &#8804;13 6,732 19.53 14-17 12,902 37.44 18-24 7,633 22.15 &#8805;25 7,198 20.89 Gender Boy/man only 5,136 14.90 Girl/woman only 23,387 67.86 TGD 5,942 17.24 Race and ethnicity a Asian 2,054 5.96 Black / African American 5,141 14.92 Hispanic / Latinx 6,448 18.71 Middle Eastern / North African / Arab 414 1.2 Native American / Native Alaskan / Indigenous 1,639 4.76 Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander 483 1.4 Other 1,418 4.11 White 20,631 59.85 Note: For a more detailed breakdown of the transgender and gender diverse (TGD) category, please see the Supplement, available online. a Race and ethnicity were assigned via a multiple selection item; percentages do not sum to 100 because texters could select multiple responses and because there were some missing data for this item. Natural Language Processing: Sentence Classification and Named Entity Recognition Words describing suicide methods are commonly used in other contexts. Consider the word &#8220;hang&#8221;: &#8220;I am planning to hang myself&#8221; should be extracted as a mention of a suicide method, whereas &#8220;I&#8217;m planning to hang out with my cousin&#8221; should not. To maximize the accuracy of extracted suicide methods, we took this approach: Sentence Classification We extended the RoBERTa large language model (LLM) 24 to train a sentence classifier to detect the point in the conversation when the counselor asked about suicide methods. Named Entity Recognition Once we detected the crisis counselor asking about suicide methods, we used a Transformer-based named entity recognition (NER) model that extended the RoBERTa LLM to extract planned suicide methods from the texter&#8217;s response. 24 Alternative Extraction Using Regular Expressions For cases in which the sentence classifier did not detect a suicide method question, we used combinations of regular expressions to check each texter message for suicide methods. Additional detail is provided in the Supplement ( Supplemental Methods ), available online. Clustering After extracting mentions of suicide methods by texters, we performed unsupervised clustering to group them. We used a Transformers-based framework (BERTopic 25 ) that leverages sentence embeddings to cluster them based on their semantic meaning. We condensed 20 initial clusters conceptually by manually grouping them ( Supplement : Supplemental Methods ; Table S11 , available online), resulting in 9 clusters of planned suicide methods that we analyzed: overdose, asphyxiation, drowning, firearms, hanging, jumping, poisoning, vehicles, and sharp objects. In addition, an &#8220;other&#8221; category included cases not categorized into one of those clusters. Therefore, the final analysis was conducted on 10 clusters. Demographic Data Demographic data were collected via a post-conversation survey completed by approximately 20% of texters. We considered 4 age bins: age 13 years and younger; age 14 to 17 years; age 18 to 24 years, and age 25 years and over. For gender, we considered 3 gender categories: Girl/Woman only (texters whose only selected response was girl/woman), Boy/Man only, and TGD (texters who selected any combination of other choices). Of the TGD group, the gender selections were as follows: 9.8% agender, 13.8% genderfluid, 14.8% genderqueer, 0.3% intersex, 22.0% nonbinary, 35.0% transgender (selecting Trans, Trans Masculine, or Trans Feminine), 0.8% Two Spirit, and 23.7% write-in. Of the TGD group, 4.6% additionally selected Girl/Woman and 5.2% additionally selected Boy/Man. (For example, texters might select &#8216;Trans&#8217; and &#8216;Girl/Woman&#8217;). Additional detail on demographic data assessment is provided in the Supplement ( Supplemental Methods ), available online. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.3.1. Our primary aim was to identify possible age by gender interactions. For each of the 10 planned suicide methods (including &#8220;other&#8221;), we built a logistic regression predicting the presence/absence of that method, with age, gender, and the age by gender interaction as predictors. Interactions and main effects were considered significant at p &lt; .005 (Bonferroni correction for 10 planned suicide methods). We used a sum-coding contrast scheme to permit evaluation of main effects. 26 To identify significant interactions, we constructed identical models without the interaction terms and compared these nested models using analysis of variance. To identify significant main effects, we constructed models that included 1 main effect and the interaction term, and compared these to the full model using analysis of variance. 26 Significant main effects were followed by comparison of marginal means to identify group differences (using the emmeans package), corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey method). The 95% confidence intervals for display purposes/error bars were calculated using ci (gmodels package); the 95% confidence intervals for full regression tables were calculated using tab_model (sjPlot package). Results In order of frequency, the most common planned suicide methods mentioned by texters were as follows: overdose (present in 51.7% of conversations), sharp objects (34.6%), hanging (13.7%), firearms (9.8%), jumping (9.4%), vehicles (7.0%), poison (7.0%), drowning (5.2%), and asphyxiation (2.2%). An &#8220;other&#8221; category (7.5%) captured mainly noise and classification errors. Complete results of the logistic regression for each planned suicide method are provided in the Supplement ( Tables S1-S10 ), available online, and are visualized in Figure 1 . Methods and results regarding performance of the NLP/ML pipeline are given in the the Supplement ( Supplemental Methods : Performance of the NLP/ML Pipeline; Tables S12 and S13 , available online). These patterns have been largely stable over time (Supplement: Table S14 , available online). Figure 1 Planned Suicide Methods by Age Group and Gender Main Effect of Age For all 10 planned suicide methods, there was a significant main effect of age ( Table 2 ; Figure 2 ). Some methods were more common in older individuals, whereas others were more common in younger individuals, as discussed below.

Figure 2 Planned Suicide Methods by Gender Suicide methods more common at younger ages: &#8226; Sharp objects: The frequency of this method decreased as age group increased. (Note, this was qualified by a significant age by gender interaction [see below]). &#8226; Hanging: There was a significant decrease from one age group to the next until age 18 to 24 years; the 18- to 24-year age group did not significantly differ from the 25 years and older group. &#8226; Jumping: This method was highest in the 13 years and younger age group, which significantly differed from all other age groups. There were no other significant differences between groups. &#8226; Drowning: This method was significantly higher in the 13 years and younger age group than in every other group. It was higher in the 14 to 17 years age group than in the 18 to 24 years age group. Suicide methods more common at older ages: &#8226; Overdose: This method was higher in all older age groups than it was in the 13 years and younger age group. There were no other significant differences across groups. (It should be noted that this was qualified by a significant age by gender interaction, as discussed below.) &#8226; Firearms: The 2 youngest age groups did not differ from each other. After that, there was a significant increase at each age group. (It should be noted that this was qualified by a significant age by gender interaction, as discussed below.) &#8226; Vehicles: There was a significant increase from one age group to the next until age 18 to 24 years; the age 18- to 24-year group did not significantly differ from the age 25 years and older group. &#8226; Poison: The 13 years and younger and the 14- to 17-year age groups did not differ significantly. The 13 years and younger and the 14- to 17-year age groups were significantly lower than the age groups 18 to 24 years and 25 years and over. The 18- to 24-year group also was significantly lower than the 25 years and over group. &#8226; Asphyxiation: The 13 years and younger group and the 14- to 17-year groups were significantly lower than the 18- to 24-year and 25 year and older groups. The 18- to 24- year group was lower than the 25 years and older group. &#8226; Other: The 25 years and older group was higher than all other age groups. Main Effect of Gender For some planned suicide methods, there was a significant main effect of gender ( Table 2 ; Figure 3 ). Suicide methods with a significant main effect of gender included overdose, hanging, firearms, jumping, vehicle, poison, asphyxiation, and other. (Athough there was no significant main effect of gender for sharp object, this was qualified by a significant age by gender interaction, as discussed below.) Figure 3 Planned Suicide Methods by Age Group Suicide methods more common in the Boy/Man group: &#8226; Hanging: There were significant differences among all groups. Girl/Woman was lowest, TGD was intermediate, and Boy/Man was highest. &#8226; Firearms: Boy/Man was significantly higher than both Girl/Woman and TGD. (It should be noted that this was qualified by a significant age by gender interaction, as discussed below.) &#8226; Vehicle: Boy/Man was significantly higher than both Girl/Woman and TGD. &#8226; Jumping, Asphyxiation, and Other: Girl/Woman was significantly lower than both Boy/Man and TGD. Suicide method more common in the TGD group: &#8226; Poison: TGD was significantly higher than both Boy/Man and Girl/Woman. Suicide method more common in the Girl/Woman group: &#8226; Overdose: There were significant differences among all groups. Boy/Man was lowest; TGD was intermediate, and Girl/Woman was highest. (It should be noted that this was qualified by a significant age by gender interaction, as discussed below.) Age by Gender Interactions To evaluate significant age by gender interactions, we compared nested models that included the interaction to those that included the main effects of age and gender only. The following planned suicide methods had significant age by gender interactions (Bonferroni corrected at p &lt; .005 for 10 planned suicide methods): overdose, &#967; 2 (6) = 33.10, p = .00001; firearms, &#967; 2 (6) = 30.48, p = .00003; and sharp object, &#967; 2 (6) = 21.82, p = .001305. For these planned suicide methods, we examined age effects in each gender group to understand the significant age by gender interaction. &#8226; Overdose: For Boy/Man, overdose increased across age bands; age 13 and younger differed from all older ages; age 14 to 17 differed from age 25 and older. For TGD, overdose increased to age 14 to 17 and then declined; overdose was less common at age 13 and younger than at age 14 to 17 and 18 to 24; overdose was more common at age 14 to 17 than at age 25 and older. For Girl/Woman, overdose plateaued at age 14 to 17; overdose was less common in the 13 and younger age group than all other ages, and there were no other significant group differences. &#8226; Firearms: For Boy/Man, firearms were highest at age 25 years and over; that age band significantly differed from age 13 and younger and age 14 to 17. For TGD, firearms were highest at age 25 and over; all other age bands were significantly lower. For Girl/Woman, firearms were highest at age 25 and over; that age band significantly differed from all other age bands. In addition, age 18 to 24 was higher than age 17 and over. &#8226; Sharp object: For Boy/Man and for Girl/Woman, all possible age comparisons were significant: sharp objects decreased across age bands. For TGD, sharp objects decreased from age 13 years and younger to age 14 to 17, and from age 14 to 17 to age 18 to 24. Discussion In this large diverse sample of individuals in crisis discussing planned suicide methods, we used a unique NLP/ML pipeline to extract and classify methods. Overall, we found that the most common methods in this sample included overdose (present in 51.7% of conversations), sharp objects (34.6%), hanging (13.7%), and firearms (9.8%). This is consistent with existing epidemiological literature that shows that poisoning (including overdose) is the most common method in nonfatal suicide attempts. 14 To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine whether gender differences in suicide methods are stable across development or whether they emerge during adolescence or early adulthood. We found main effects of age for each planned suicide method. Methods including sharp objects, hanging, jumping, and drowning were most common at younger age bands. Other methods were most common in older texters, including overdose, firearms, vehicles, poison, and asphyxiation. Age differences may reflect differences in access or knowledge (particularly for firearms and vehicles). Parents, providers, and public health officials should be aware that sharp objects, hanging, jumping, and drowning may be particularly likely to be involved in suicide plans of children and adolescents 13 years of age and younger. Our results recapitulate some well-known gender differences, including higher selection of methods including firearms, jumping, and hanging in the Boy/Man group than in the Girl/Woman group, and greater planning of overdose methods in the Girl/Woman group than in the Boy/Man group. Our study expands a sparse existing literature on suicide methods in TGD individuals. We found differing patterns for this group by suicide method. This pattern reflects a complex interplay between suicide method and gender identity. For several suicide methods, gender effects differed across age groups. The increase across age bands in overdose for the Boy/Man group, steep increase in firearms between ages 18 and 24 years and 25 years and older in the Girl/Woman and TGD groups, and shallower plateauing of sharp objects in the TGD group all suggest gender-specific age patterns that warrant further investigation. This study has limitations. First, the sample may be unrepresentative (of the US population, individuals in crisis, and/or the Crisis Text Line texter pool): (1) individuals in this sample completed the voluntary post-conversation survey; survey takers may differ from non&#8211;survey takers; and (2) texters who required an emergency services intervention are not included in this analysis (though as a supplemental analysis, we did examine planned suicide methods in emergency services intervention conversations, which were quite similar to the conversations in the current analysis [ Supplemental Figure S1 , available online]). Second, we did not assess sex assigned at birth, and we did not formally assess cisgender vs transgender identity. The gender distribution of texters to this service is not representative of the US population: for example, there are relatively few texters identifying as boy/man only. Although the raw numbers are still large enough for analysis, the unusual gender distribution should be noted. Finally, although the sample included individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds ( Table 1 ), analysis of possible racial or ethnic differences in planned suicide methods was not performed; this could be an important future direction. This study also has a number of strengths. Our sample includes more than 6,000 children 13 years of age and younger, a population that is understudied and shows unique patterns in our dataset. We found that the youngest group was more likely to select planned suicide methods including sharp objects, hanging, jumping, and drowning. Clinicians and family members should be aware that younger suicidal individuals may be more likely than older people to select these methods, and should plan carefully when assessing and restricting access to means. In addition, we included more than 5,000 TGD individuals, who showed complex patterns across suicide methods and were more likely than other people to select poison as a planned suicide method. To our knowledge, only 1 prior study of suicide methods has included more than 100 TGD individuals, and that sample included only adults. 22 Because TGD youth experience elevated rates of suicidality, understanding planned suicide methods is particularly critical for this vulnerable subpopulation. Future work could help to identify drivers of selection of different planned means across demographic groups. Overall, these findings demonstrate that across age brackets, overdose is an exceptionally common planned suicide method in crisis conversations. Further analyzing this category to examine specific drugs mentioned in overdose conversations could guide clinical and policy efforts toward more effective lethal means restriction practices. To summarize, in a large sample of text-based crisis conversations, we evaluated planned suicide means by age and gender using an NLP/ML-based extraction and classification strategy. We found broad age differences across planned methods, including more plans involving sharp objects, hanging, jumping, and drowning in the age 13 years and younger group. This study lays the groundwork for future NLP/ML-based work on unstructured, suicide-related conversational data, with potential critical implications for suicide prevention and public health.
