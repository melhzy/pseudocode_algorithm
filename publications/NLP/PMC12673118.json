One of the most important cases is residual heat (i.e., decay heat) in NPPs which is about 6 percent of thermal power, immediately after reactor shutdown<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref></sup>. For example, in a typical NPP with 3000 MWth, there is more than 180 MW of residual heat (i.e., 6% of total power including beta and gamma energy) immediately after the reactor shutdown.</p><p id=\"Par4\">RPV in NPPs (e.g., PWR) is designed in such a way that it can withstand water under high pressure and act as a safety barrier for the release of particles, especially neutron/gamma<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref></sup>. In other words, it controls part of the released energy, and for this reason, the design of RPV becomes more complicated to resist factors such as radiation embrittlement/fatigue<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref></sup>. If it is possible to design/construct an RPV that maintains the desired thermodynamic properties (e.g., keeping water under pressure), but doesn&#8217;t act as an absolute safety barrier against gamma radiation or has more attenuation length for gamma radiation; the wasted gamma radiation energy may be used and the efficiency of NPP may be increased. The proposed concept requires redesign of the RPV to allow sufficient gamma transmission, which presents significant engineering and regulatory challenges.</p><p id=\"Par5\">In this study, by using the developments that have been made in the field of design and construction of nuclear batteries<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref></sup>, an attempt is made to provide a conceptual framework for the possibility of using part of the wasted heat in NPPs. The use of wasted heat and the production of useful energy can be effective in increasing the efficiency of NPP. In addition, safety advantages include access to a reliable power source during various accidents, which can reduce their severity, and less radiation being released between RPV and containment are possible.</p><p id=\"Par6\">These kinds of studies are important, especially taking into consideration some researches comparing the nuclear energy in to renewable energy. They argue that the future of nuclear energy, even with innovative reactors such as modular ones, remains uncertain<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref></sup>. The nuclear energy efficiency has been compared with the renewable energy<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref></sup> without paying particular attention to the 24-h availability of nuclear energy, production of minimal greenhouse, providing stable base-load power, operating at high capacity factor (i.e., 92.5% in comparison with 24.9% of solar energy), and producing high energy density<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref></sup>. These issues highlight the need for new methods to enhance the efficiency/safety/reliability of current/future NPPs even more than before.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Methods</title><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>A brief review of nuclear batteries</title><p id=\"Par7\">Nuclear batteries can be divided into two general categories including thermal and non-thermal batteries which are presented in Fig.&#160;<xref rid=\"Fig1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>.<fig id=\"Fig1\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Different types of nuclear batteries.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" id=\"MO1\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\" xlink:href=\"41598_2025_27148_Fig1_HTML.jpg\"/></fig></p><p id=\"Par8\">Thermal nuclear batteries are known mainly as radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG)<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref></sup>. In this type of battery, the thermal energy produced from the particle/radiation emitted from radioisotope decay is used to produce electricity. In fact, the heat emitted from the radioactive decay of the nucleus is given to a thermal-electric generator to convert heat into electricity. The efficiency of these batteries is typically around 5% to 7%. It is worth mentioning that RTG is the most famous type of thermal convertor nuclear battery. Other types of thermal converters include thermionic and Stirling nuclear batteries<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id=\"Par9\">Direct charge batteries use the emitted charged particles directly (i.e., alpha/beta particles) to generate electricity. In these batteries, the emitted particles are collected by a semiconductor/conductive material, where the electrodes directly convert these charged particles into electric current. The efficiency of direct charge nuclear batteries may reach 20%, theoretically<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id=\"Par10\">Direct energy conversion batteries refer to converting nuclear energy directly into electrical energy. If electricity is produced as a result of the interaction of alpha or beta particles with a semiconductor (i.e., similar to a photovoltaic cell), it is called alphavolatic and betavoltaic, respectively, and if electricity is produced as a result of the interaction of emitted heat (i.e., generated by the interaction of radiation with an object) with a photovoltaic cell, it is called thermophotovoltaic (TPV). The alphavolatic efficiency is less than 1%<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref></sup> and betavoltaic efficiency is reached, theoretically, up to 30%<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref></sup> and thermophotovoltaic efficiency is almost 35% with a very high-temperature emitter<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id=\"Par11\">Indirect energy conversion battery uses energy emitted from nuclear decay and convert it into electrical power by using a photon intermediate which is referred to photon intermediate direct energy conversion (PIDEC)<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref></sup>. In this type of battery, any radiation emitter (i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and even neutron emitters) can be used. The particles/radiation emitted from the radioisotope nucleus excite the material it encounters, which is called <italic toggle=\"yes\">excimer.</italic></p><p id=\"Par12\">Ref.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref></sup>, and when the material returns to its ground state, the additional energy is emitted as light (e.g., narrow-band ultraviolet light). The produced light is ultimately converted into electrical energy by a photovoltaic cell. The schematic of PIDEC operation is shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid=\"Fig2\" ref-type=\"fig\">2</xref>. PIDEC batteries can achieve an efficiency of up to 40% for single-cycle energy conversion. Research suggests that combining PIDEC with an additional thermodynamic cycle (i.e., Stirling engine) could boost total system efficiency up to 48%<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref></sup>.<fig id=\"Fig2\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A schematic presentation of PIDEC battery.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" id=\"MO2\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\" xlink:href=\"41598_2025_27148_Fig2_HTML.jpg\"/></fig></p></sec><sec id=\"Sec4\"><title>Utilization of nuclear battery with gamma radiation</title><p id=\"Par13\">What was said about the efficiency of nuclear batteries was about the use of radioisotopes that basically generate charged particles. Because charged particles (i.e., alpha and beta) release their energy in a small region and provide almost all their energy to nuclear batteries (i.e., in RTG, TPV, PIDEC, and direct charge batteries). This is not true for gamma radiation, which has a low attenuation coefficient and requires large volumes to fully deposit its energy. In addition, gamma rays have a low interaction cross-section with semiconductor materials, which limits the generation of electron&#8211;hole pairs and reduces current in batteries like alphavolatic/betavoltaic. The challenges associated with gamma-ray shielding are another reason gamma-emitting radioisotopes are not commonly used in nuclear batteries. However, by implementing specific measures, gamma radiation can be used effectively to produce electricity in nuclear batteries. For this purpose, a brief look is taken at scintillators that convert gamma radiation into visible light including 1- Organic scintillators (i.e., liquid, plastic, and crystal)<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref></sup> 2- Inorganic scintillators (e.g., NaI(Tl), CsI, BGO,</p><p id=\"Par14\">and LYSO)<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref></sup> and 3- Nobel gas scintillators<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR27\">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id=\"Par15\">However, by implementing specific measures, gamma radiation can be used effectively to produce electricity in nuclear batteries.

Therefore, it can be said that the amount of light attenuation in plastic is not very important, even in large scintillator thicknesses. The plastic scintillator is considered in this conceptual framework because it is one of the cheapest and most easily available types of scintillators. In addition, producing the large-sized plastic scintillators is possible, whereas producing large-sized inorganic scintillators is so complicated.</p><p id=\"Par18\">By taking into account the properties of scintillators, especially plastic scintillators, and also understanding the operation of a PIDEC battery, it is possible to design a battery that uses a plastic scintillator as an excimer in the PIDEC system. This design would convert the energy of the Gamma-rays exited from the nuclear reactor into electric power.

From the safety/shileding viewpoint, using plastic scintillator between RPV and containment to produce electric power is very useful for efficient reduction of gamm dose level making possible using of partial containment. However, it should be note that for reduction of containment dimensions, it is necessary to take into account the considerations of beyond design basis accidents (BDBAs)/design extended conditions (DEC)/severe accidents<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref></sup>. Another safety advantage of using PIDEC around RPV is to access a reliable power source in the containment during various accidents reducing their severity.</p><p id=\"Par24\">The another interesting point is that plastic scintillators are also suitable for neutron absorption (e.g., plastic scintillators are used to discriminate gamma and neutrons)<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref></sup>. Therefore, plastic scintillators are also suitable for reducing the neutron dose. For example, considering the attenuation coefficient of fast neutrons in PVT which is a hydrogen-rich organic scintillator and the average value for the fast neutrons energy which is about 2 MeV<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref></sup>, the attunation length is.</p><p id=\"Par25\">given by Eq.&#160;(<xref rid=\"Equ2\" ref-type=\"disp-formula\">2</xref>).

The light yield for fast neutrons is generally around 20&#8211;30% of that for gamma rays<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref></sup> in plastic scintillators, largely because the energy transfer from neutrons to protons (i.e., recoil nuclei) is less efficient in producing scintillation light than direct ionization by gamma interactions.</p><p id=\"Par28\">What is clear is that the use of the proposed combination of NPP and nuclear battery is possible when the RPV does not contain strong attenuator materials for gamma radiation. Otherwise, the amount of electricity produced will be insignificant. The approximate power of gamma radiation between RPV<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref></sup> (i.e., currrent RPVs) and containment is given with considering the thickness of RPV in PWRs about 20&#8211;30 cm and its (i.e., carbon-steel) macroscopic gamma attenuation coefficient about 0.4 <italic toggle=\"yes\">cm</italic><sup><italic toggle=\"yes\">-1</italic></sup> for gamma rays with average energy of 1 MeV.

This will provide a precise evaluation of the power generation capacity and overall system efficiency, accounting for real-world geometries, material properties, and neutron-gamma coupling.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec10\"><title>Conclusion</title><p id=\"Par43\">In this study, a conceptual framework is presented which combines a photon intermediate direct energy conversion (PIDEC) battery with a nuclear power plant (NPP) to increase the safety and efficiency of NPP. The basis of proposed system is based on the use of plastic scintillators (e.g., PVT) as an available/cheap excimer in PIDEC in order to use the power of gamma radiation in NPP and to produce visible light, as well as, electric energy. Ideally, this proposed system can produce about 0.1% of the NPP electric power in normal operation and more than 0.002% of the electric power when the reactor is shut down. The requirement for this issue is the possibility of redesigning the RPV to absorb less gamma. In other words, it can be said that the proposed system is a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the electric power based on the possible minimization of gamma radiation absorption in the RPV, taking into account constraints such as maintaining the cooling pressure, maintaining the integrity of the RPV in nuclear accidents, etc. The approach for optimization can be given by nonlinear programming (NLP)/ evolutionary algorithms (EA). The proposed system may improve safety margins (e.g., auxiliary power availability, potential for lighter containment), but such benefits remain speculative until validated by further simulation, prototyping, and regulatory assessment. The efficiency gains, even under idealized assumptions, are modest (&#8776; 0.1% of total plant output). The minimum benefit of the proposed system is that it improves safety and possibly enables a lighter containment design, add a reliable power source in the containment during different accidents and ideally improves the electrical efficiency of an NPP by redesigning the RPV to absorb less gamma. It is clear that the proposed system in adding plastic scintillators/photovoltaic cells, in possible lighten of the containment weight, and in the redesign of the RPV with the possibility of less gamma absorption has very little cost compared to the advantages obtained which are a considerable increase in electric power and in safety.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type=\"author-contribution\"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Khalil Moshkbar-Bakhshayesh is the sole author of this manuscript and is responsible for all aspects of the work, including conceptualization, methodology, data collection, analysis, and manuscript preparation.</p></notes><notes notes-type=\"funding-information\"><title>Funding</title><p>The authors declare that this study has been conducted without any external funding.</p></notes><notes notes-type=\"data-availability\"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data will be available from the corresponding author (i.e., Khalil Moshkbar-Bakhshayesh), upon reasonable request.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id=\"FPar1\" notes-type=\"COI-statement\"><title>Competing interests</title><p id=\"Par44\">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id=\"Bib1\"><title>References</title><ref id=\"CR1\"><label>1.</label><citation-alternatives><element-citation id=\"ec-CR1\" publication-type=\"journal\"><person-group person-group-type=\"author\"><name name-style=\"western\"><surname>Marques</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evolution of nuclear fission reactors: Third generation and beyond</article-title><source>Energy Convers.

The safety and efficiency of nuclear power plants (NPPs) rely on effective energy use and accident mitigation. A major challenge is managing gamma radiation within reactor containment, which is usually absorbed by structures and wasted. Photon Intermediate Direct Energy Conversion (PIDEC) addresses this by converting gamma radiation into usable power. A PIDEC battery uses plastic scintillators to transform gamma rays into visible light, then converts it to electricity. This supplementary power system can enhance NPP performance and safety. Implementation requires reactor pressure vessel (RPV) modifications to reduce gamma absorption by internal structures. The design poses a constrained optimization problem&#8212;maximizing energy capture while maintaining coolant pressure and RPV integrity under normal and emergency conditions. Benefits include higher efficiency, improved safety, and potential weight reduction of containment structures. By enabling gamma photon extraction, PIDEC could provide reliable auxiliary power during accidents, reducing reliance on external emergency systems. A cost&#8211;benefit analysis suggests that integrating plastic scintillators and photovoltaic elements would add minimal expense while delivering notable gains in output and safety. PIDEC thus represents a conceptual advancement in NPP technology, turning otherwise wasted radiation into a strategic resource for both routine and emergency operations.

Despite all the advances, there are still cases that pose safety challenges. One of the most important cases is residual heat (i.e., decay heat) in NPPs which is about 6 percent of thermal power, immediately after reactor shutdown 4 . For example, in a typical NPP with 3000 MWth, there is more than 180 MW of residual heat (i.e., 6% of total power including beta and gamma energy) immediately after the reactor shutdown. RPV in NPPs (e.g., PWR) is designed in such a way that it can withstand water under high pressure and act as a safety barrier for the release of particles, especially neutron/gamma 5 . In other words, it controls part of the released energy, and for this reason, the design of RPV becomes more complicated to resist factors such as radiation embrittlement/fatigue 6 . If it is possible to design/construct an RPV that maintains the desired thermodynamic properties (e.g., keeping water under pressure), but doesn&#8217;t act as an absolute safety barrier against gamma radiation or has more attenuation length for gamma radiation; the wasted gamma radiation energy may be used and the efficiency of NPP may be increased. The proposed concept requires redesign of the RPV to allow sufficient gamma transmission, which presents significant engineering and regulatory challenges. In this study, by using the developments that have been made in the field of design and construction of nuclear batteries 7 , 8 , an attempt is made to provide a conceptual framework for the possibility of using part of the wasted heat in NPPs. The use of wasted heat and the production of useful energy can be effective in increasing the efficiency of NPP. In addition, safety advantages include access to a reliable power source during various accidents, which can reduce their severity, and less radiation being released between RPV and containment are possible. These kinds of studies are important, especially taking into consideration some researches comparing the nuclear energy in to renewable energy. They argue that the future of nuclear energy, even with innovative reactors such as modular ones, remains uncertain 9 . The nuclear energy efficiency has been compared with the renewable energy 10 without paying particular attention to the 24-h availability of nuclear energy, production of minimal greenhouse, providing stable base-load power, operating at high capacity factor (i.e., 92.5% in comparison with 24.9% of solar energy), and producing high energy density 11 . These issues highlight the need for new methods to enhance the efficiency/safety/reliability of current/future NPPs even more than before. Methods A brief review of nuclear batteries Nuclear batteries can be divided into two general categories including thermal and non-thermal batteries which are presented in Fig.&#160; 1 . Fig. 1 Different types of nuclear batteries. Thermal nuclear batteries are known mainly as radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) 12 . In this type of battery, the thermal energy produced from the particle/radiation emitted from radioisotope decay is used to produce electricity. In fact, the heat emitted from the radioactive decay of the nucleus is given to a thermal-electric generator to convert heat into electricity. The efficiency of these batteries is typically around 5% to 7%. It is worth mentioning that RTG is the most famous type of thermal convertor nuclear battery. Other types of thermal converters include thermionic and Stirling nuclear batteries 13 , 14 . Direct charge batteries use the emitted charged particles directly (i.e., alpha/beta particles) to generate electricity. In these batteries, the emitted particles are collected by a semiconductor/conductive material, where the electrodes directly convert these charged particles into electric current. The efficiency of direct charge nuclear batteries may reach 20%, theoretically 15 . Direct energy conversion batteries refer to converting nuclear energy directly into electrical energy. If electricity is produced as a result of the interaction of alpha or beta particles with a semiconductor (i.e., similar to a photovoltaic cell), it is called alphavolatic and betavoltaic, respectively, and if electricity is produced as a result of the interaction of emitted heat (i.e., generated by the interaction of radiation with an object) with a photovoltaic cell, it is called thermophotovoltaic (TPV). The alphavolatic efficiency is less than 1% 16 and betavoltaic efficiency is reached, theoretically, up to 30% 17 and thermophotovoltaic efficiency is almost 35% with a very high-temperature emitter 18 &#8211; 21 . Indirect energy conversion battery uses energy emitted from nuclear decay and convert it into electrical power by using a photon intermediate which is referred to photon intermediate direct energy conversion (PIDEC) 22 . In this type of battery, any radiation emitter (i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and even neutron emitters) can be used. The particles/radiation emitted from the radioisotope nucleus excite the material it encounters, which is called excimer. Ref. 23 , and when the material returns to its ground state, the additional energy is emitted as light (e.g., narrow-band ultraviolet light). The produced light is ultimately converted into electrical energy by a photovoltaic cell. The schematic of PIDEC operation is shown in Fig.&#160; 2 . PIDEC batteries can achieve an efficiency of up to 40% for single-cycle energy conversion. Research suggests that combining PIDEC with an additional thermodynamic cycle (i.e., Stirling engine) could boost total system efficiency up to 48% 24 . Fig. 2 A schematic presentation of PIDEC battery. Utilization of nuclear battery with gamma radiation What was said about the efficiency of nuclear batteries was about the use of radioisotopes that basically generate charged particles. Because charged particles (i.e., alpha and beta) release their energy in a small region and provide almost all their energy to nuclear batteries (i.e., in RTG, TPV, PIDEC, and direct charge batteries). This is not true for gamma radiation, which has a low attenuation coefficient and requires large volumes to fully deposit its energy. In addition, gamma rays have a low interaction cross-section with semiconductor materials, which limits the generation of electron&#8211;hole pairs and reduces current in batteries like alphavolatic/betavoltaic. The challenges associated with gamma-ray shielding are another reason gamma-emitting radioisotopes are not commonly used in nuclear batteries. However, by implementing specific measures, gamma radiation can be used effectively to produce electricity in nuclear batteries. For this purpose, a brief look is taken at scintillators that convert gamma radiation into visible light including 1- Organic scintillators (i.e., liquid, plastic, and crystal) 25 2- Inorganic scintillators (e.g., NaI(Tl), CsI, BGO, and LYSO) 26 and 3- Nobel gas scintillators 27 .

There are several methods for estimating the light yield of scintillators 28 . The number of luminescence photons per 1 MeV of gamma radiation is given in Table 1 29 &#8211; 31 . It should be note that the gaseous scintillators are not considered since they have a very low attenuation coefficient and are not suitable for this conceptual framework. The number of photons in NaI(Tl) and plastic scintillators is about 40 &#8201;&#215;&#8201; 10 3 /MeV and 10 &#8201;&#215;&#8201; 10 3 /MeV photons, respectively 32 . In addition to number of photons production, it is also essential to consider the attenuation length, which is the distance that the light intensity decreases to 1/e of its original value, as given by Eq.&#160;( 1 ), to correctly estimate the number of light photons reaching the photovoltaic cells. 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$I(x) \\approx I_{0} \\exp ( - \\frac{1}{{\\lambda_{a} }}x)$$\\end{document} where, x is thickness of scintillator, I 0 is initial light intensity and &#955; a is attenuation length of light photons. Table 1 Photon yields per 1 MeV of gamma radiation for different types of scintillators. Scintillator material Photon yield (photons/MeV) NaI(Tl) 30,000&#8211;40,000 CsI(Tl) 45,000&#8211;55,000 BGO 8000&#8211;10,000 LYSO 32,000&#8211;40,000 Plastic 8000&#8211;10,000 The attenuation length of light photons in a plastic scintillator typically varies from a few hundred centimeters to a meter 33 . In higher quality scintillators (e.g., EJ-260), the attenuation length is about 350 cm 34 , 35 . Therefore, it can be said that the amount of light attenuation in plastic is not very important, even in large scintillator thicknesses. The plastic scintillator is considered in this conceptual framework because it is one of the cheapest and most easily available types of scintillators. In addition, producing the large-sized plastic scintillators is possible, whereas producing large-sized inorganic scintillators is so complicated. By taking into account the properties of scintillators, especially plastic scintillators, and also understanding the operation of a PIDEC battery, it is possible to design a battery that uses a plastic scintillator as an excimer in the PIDEC system. This design would convert the energy of the Gamma-rays exited from the nuclear reactor into electric power. Figure&#160; 3 schematically presents this type of PIDEC. Fig. 3 A schematic view of PIDEC battery with plastic scintillator. Investigation of the proposed combination of nuclear battery and NPP Plastic Scintillators are typically made of materials like polyvinyl toluene (PVT) or polystyrene (PS) 36 . In this study, PVT is considered because it has appropriate 1-Scintillation efficiency (i.e., high light output and fast response times) 2- Mechanical properties (durability, flexibility, and easy. to mold) 3- Optical transmission 4- Customizability and is 5-Cost effective 36 . The. PVT chemical structure consists of a vinyl group (i.e., C 2 H 3 ) attached to a toluene group (i.e., C 7 H 8 ) with mass of 119 g/mol and density of 1.02 g/cm 3 , 37 . The PVTs have low atomic numbers, making them low density. Therefore, compton scattering is the dominant interaction mechanism for mid-energy gamma rays (i.e., between 0.1 and 10 MeV). For PVT-based plastic scintillators, attenuation lengths for gamma photons typically range from. 10 to 20 cm for average gamma energies around 1 MeV 38 . The given estimations vary somewhat based on the exact formulation of the plastic. For precise values, radiation transport simulations, Monte Carlo codes, or detailed experimental measurements are more appropriate. From the safety/shileding viewpoint, using plastic scintillator between RPV and containment to produce electric power is very useful for efficient reduction of gamm dose level making possible using of partial containment. However, it should be note that for reduction of containment dimensions, it is necessary to take into account the considerations of beyond design basis accidents (BDBAs)/design extended conditions (DEC)/severe accidents 39 . Another safety advantage of using PIDEC around RPV is to access a reliable power source in the containment during various accidents reducing their severity. The another interesting point is that plastic scintillators are also suitable for neutron absorption (e.g., plastic scintillators are used to discriminate gamma and neutrons) 40 . Therefore, plastic scintillators are also suitable for reducing the neutron dose. For example, considering the attenuation coefficient of fast neutrons in PVT which is a hydrogen-rich organic scintillator and the average value for the fast neutrons energy which is about 2 MeV 41 , the attunation length is. given by Eq.&#160;( 2 ). Where, &#931; H and &#931; C are the total cross sections of hydrogen and carbon for neutrons with average energy of 2 MeV, respectively, &#931; t is total cross section of PVT, and L is average. attenuation length of neutrons in PVT. The approximate value of the attenuation length indicates that the plastic scintillator weakens the energy of neutrons to a suitable level and is effective in reducing the neutron dose. 2 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\begin{gathered} \\Sigma_{t,PVT} \\approx \\Sigma_{H,PVT} + \\Sigma_{C,PVT} = 5.6 \\times 10^{22} \\times 4 \\times 10^{ - 24} + 4.6 \\times 10^{22} \\times 1 \\times 10^{ - 24} \\times 1 = 0.27 \\hfill \\\\ \\Rightarrow L_{PVT} \\approx \\frac{1}{{\\Sigma_{t,PVT} }} = \\frac{1}{0.27} = 3.7 \\, cm \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered}$$\\end{document} Despite this advantage for safety, the power of neutrons (i.e., fast neutrons) and their light yield efficiency is small compared to gamma radiation and has less impact on the production of electrical power through plastic scintillators. The light yield for fast neutrons is generally around 20&#8211;30% of that for gamma rays 42 in plastic scintillators, largely because the energy transfer from neutrons to protons (i.e., recoil nuclei) is less efficient in producing scintillation light than direct ionization by gamma interactions. What is clear is that the use of the proposed combination of NPP and nuclear battery is possible when the RPV does not contain strong attenuator materials for gamma radiation. Otherwise, the amount of electricity produced will be insignificant. The approximate power of gamma radiation between RPV 43 (i.e., currrent RPVs) and containment is given with considering the thickness of RPV in PWRs about 20&#8211;30 cm and its (i.e., carbon-steel) macroscopic gamma attenuation coefficient about 0.4 cm -1 for gamma rays with average energy of 1 MeV. With these assumptions, gamma power between RPV and containment is approximately given by Eq.&#160;( 3 ). For example, for a PWR with 3000 MWth, the generated electricity by gamma power between RPV and containment is less than 60 W. Therefore, by considering the current state of the RPVs, using plastic scintillators around the RPV only increase the radiation protection in the containment. 3 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\begin{gathered} P_{RPV - Containment,gamma} \\approx P_{{{\\text{reached RPV, }}gamma}} \\exp ( - \\Sigma_{RPV} t_{RPV} ) \\hfill \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\frac{{P_{RPV - Containment,gamma} }}{{P_{{{\\text{reached RPV, }}gamma}} }} \\approx \\exp ( - 0.4\\frac{1}{cm} \\times 25 \\, cm) \\approx 4.5 \\times 10^{ - 5} \\hfill \\\\ \\Rightarrow P_{RPV - Containment,gamma} \\approx 4.5 \\times 10^{ - 5} \\times 90 \\times 10^{6} \\approx 4kW_{th} \\hfill \\\\ \\Rightarrow P_{gamma - to - electricit} &lt; 4000 \\times \\frac{{10^{13} }}{1.6}\\frac{MeV}{s} \\times 10000\\frac{photons}{{MeV}} \\times 2.5\\frac{eV}{{photons}} \\approx 60W \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered}$$\\end{document} Results Gamma radiation power estimation The electric efficiency of the proposed system (i.e., combining PIDEC nuclear battery with plastic scintillator as an excimer and a typical NPP) presented in Fig.&#160; 4 can be calculated.

The arrangement shown is conceptual and two-dimensional for clarity. A practical implementation would involve a three-dimensional array of cells optimally arranged to maximize gamma photon capture from the reactor pressure vessel. In the normal operation of NPPs almost 50&#8211;70 percent (i.e., on average 60%) of delayed/prompt gamma radiation is absorbed before reactor pressure vessel (RPV) (i.e., in fuel matrix/cooling system/structures) 44 , 45 . In addition, 30&#8211;50 percent (i.e., on average 40%) of neutrons are absorbed in structure which generate 10&#8211;20 percent (i.e., on average 15%) gamma rays ( i.e., neutron capture gamma rays) 46 .

It is important to mention that in a reactor, about 2.5% of the total energy is related to the neutrons produced in fission, and about 7% of the energy is related to the delayed/prompt gamma. After the reactor shutdown, there will be only 3.5% of the delayed gamma energy. Decay heat can be approximated by an empirical formula often used in reactor engineering which is given by Eq.&#160;( 5 ) 50 , 51 . 5 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$P(t) \\approx 0.06 \\times P_{0} \\times t^{ - 0.2}$$\\end{document} where, P(t) is the residual heat power at time t and P 0 is the initial power level before shutdown.

Also, the power of gamma radiation reached RPV during the normal operation of the NPP will be much higher and, nearing 90 MWth.

During operation, this amounts to nearly 90 MWth &#8203; for a 3000 MWth plant, while post-shutdown values average over 2 MWth &#8203; during a typical outage. These levels suggest meaningful potential for recovery rather than dissipation as waste heat. Coupling a plastic scintillator to a PIDEC conversion system enables high capture efficiency (i.e., f capture &#8203;&#8776;1) and practical light-to-electricity conversion (i.e., &#951; light-electricity &#8203;&#8201;=&#8201;0.4) with multi-junction cells. Under these conditions, the system could yield&#8201;~&#8201;885 kWe during operation and&#8201;~&#8201;20 kWe &#8203; after shutdown, sufficient for auxiliary or emergency loads. While the fractional gain in net plant efficiency is small, the recovered power could offset internal consumption and enhance resilience, particularly in blackout or post-shutdown scenarios. Key challenges for deployment include: 1- Long-term scintillator radiation tolerance 2- cooling and mechanical requirements 3- need for Monte Carlo simulations and experimental validation 4- integration within containment without impacting reactor safety systems and 5- limited practical gains unless RPV redesign. In summary, the proposed gamma energy recovery approach offers a technically viable method to harness a constant and predictable radiation field in both operational and shutdown conditions. Its integration into future NPP designs or as a retrofit feature could improve efficiency, reduce reliance on external backup systems, and strengthen the safety margin in emergency situations. It can be said that the proposed system is a constrained optimization problem (i.e., nonlinear programming (NLP)) 53 which is given by Eq.&#160;( 15 ) that maximizes the added electric power based on the possible minimization of gamma radiation absorption in the RPV, taking into account constraints such as maintaining the cooling pressure, maintaining the integrity of the RPV in nuclear accidents, etc. 15 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\begin{gathered} {\\text{maximize( }}P_{e, \\, in \\, Normal \\, operation \\, }^{The \\, proposed \\, system \\, } {, }P_{e, \\, After \\, Shutdown}^{The \\, proposed \\, system \\, } {\\text{) \\&amp; minimize RPV}}_{{gamma{\\text{ absorption}}}} \\hfill \\\\ subject \\, to:\\left\\{ \\begin{gathered} RPV_{pressure \\, \\lim itation} \\hfill \\\\ RPV_{{{\\text{int}} egrity}}^{{in \\, nuclear{\\text{ accidents}}}} \\hfill \\\\ ... \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} \\right. \\, \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered}$$\\end{document} Finally it can be said that the efficiency and power output calculations presented in this study are based on first-order physics principles and idealized assumptions to establish the conceptual viability and potential scale of gamma energy recovery. A critical next step in the development of this concept is rigorous, high-fidelity modeling using radiation transport codes such as MCNP or GEANT and other necessary models/codes. Such simulations are necessary to accurately model the complex radiation field within the containment, the energy deposition profile within the scintillator medium, the production and transport of scintillation photons, and the resulting electron&#8211;hole pair generation in the photovoltaic cells. This will provide a precise evaluation of the power generation capacity and overall system efficiency, accounting for real-world geometries, material properties, and neutron-gamma coupling. Conclusion In this study, a conceptual framework is presented which combines a photon intermediate direct energy conversion (PIDEC) battery with a nuclear power plant (NPP) to increase the safety and efficiency of NPP. The basis of proposed system is based on the use of plastic scintillators (e.g., PVT) as an available/cheap excimer in PIDEC in order to use the power of gamma radiation in NPP and to produce visible light, as well as, electric energy. Ideally, this proposed system can produce about 0.1% of the NPP electric power in normal operation and more than 0.002% of the electric power when the reactor is shut down. The requirement for this issue is the possibility of redesigning the RPV to absorb less gamma. In other words, it can be said that the proposed system is a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the electric power based on the possible minimization of gamma radiation absorption in the RPV, taking into account constraints such as maintaining the cooling pressure, maintaining the integrity of the RPV in nuclear accidents, etc. The approach for optimization can be given by nonlinear programming (NLP)/ evolutionary algorithms (EA). The proposed system may improve safety margins (e.g., auxiliary power availability, potential for lighter containment), but such benefits remain speculative until validated by further simulation, prototyping, and regulatory assessment. The efficiency gains, even under idealized assumptions, are modest (&#8776; 0.1% of total plant output). The minimum benefit of the proposed system is that it improves safety and possibly enables a lighter containment design, add a reliable power source in the containment during different accidents and ideally improves the electrical efficiency of an NPP by redesigning the RPV to absorb less gamma. It is clear that the proposed system in adding plastic scintillators/photovoltaic cells, in possible lighten of the containment weight, and in the redesign of the RPV with the possibility of less gamma absorption has very little cost compared to the advantages obtained which are a considerable increase in electric power and in safety.
