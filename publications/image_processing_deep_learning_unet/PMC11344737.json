    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease, which remains one of the main causes of death, can be prevented by early diagnosis of heart sounds. Certain noisy signals, known as murmurs, may be present in heart sounds. On auscultation, the degree of murmur is closely related to the patient’s clinical condition. Computer-aided decision-making systems can help doctors to detect murmurs and make faster decisions. The Mel spectrograms were generated from raw phonocardiograms and then presented to the OpenL3 network for transfer learning. In this way, the signals were classified to predict the presence or absence of murmurs and their level of severity. Pitch level (healthy, low, medium, high) and Levine scale (healthy, soft, loud) were used. The results obtained without prior segmentation are very impressive. The model used was then interpreted using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method, Occlusion Sensitivity. This approach shows that XAI methods are necessary to know the features used internally by the artificial neural network then to explain the automatic decision taken by the model. The averaged image of the occlusion sensitivity maps can give us either an overview or a precise detail per pixel of the features used. In the field of healthcare, particularly cardiology, for rapid diagnostic and preventive purposes, this work could provide more detail on the important features of the phonocardiogram.",
